Side scroller space shooter game C# XNA

Game I made in Visual Studio with the XNA framework

Just did it for fun to learn C# better

Classes for: player, animation, enememy, projectile (laser), upgrade object (health), parallaxing background (moving background)

Simple game where the place controls a space ship and fires a laser at oncoming mines
